# Winning With Jesus: A New Athlete: Sports Through Christianity

# Project Overview

I chose to promote religion and sports for my festival. This
organization is based off Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA). 
Over the course of three days there will be a course of different 
events to showcase there is more to a sport than just being an athlete. 
All proceeds will be donated to FCA to disburse the money to local 
sports programs and churches. 

On Day 1, I plan to have an opening worship concert with Brandon Lake 
and Elevation Worship. Both these artists are well-known Christian 
artists so they will be used to bring many people in. On Day 2, most 
events will be taken place including: Giving Back Expo to donate and 
recieve athletic necessities, a Bible study with Tim Tebow who is a 
former pro athlete who showcases his faith, and lastly a live 
demonstration of different sports having a technical clinic. 
On Day 3, we will have a prayer walk leading to an FCA Pastor 
sharing his testimony during dinner, and lastly a closing concert 
with Phil Wickhan.

I plan to make merch with a variety of faith in sports representation 
where all proceeds from buying the products will be donating to FCA.

# Technical Overview

For the font I decided to use Uppercut Angle and Newsserif Huge Variable 
from Adobe Fonts. The fonts matched best with the shape of a cross for the 
letter "T" and matched good with what my festival is portraying. With 
the colors I chose: #b2a4d4, #bebebe, #ccba78, and #ffffff. I wanted 
to implement a light gold as that was the first color I thought of when I heard gold. The grey and purple contrast works well with the white text and makes my site welcoming. 

Languages Used:

-HTML: The framework of the website, holding all my text in order.

-CSS: Styling the website with color, font-size, placement, and overall
animation, tranformations, and display.

For the home page, I used CSS to make the images scroll and give examples of what my organization is. With the use of flex-boxes I am able to format each day and events into columns and rows. Also include aspects that hold its position and don't move when you scroll and swipe.
